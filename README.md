# Social Distancing Detection and Alarm System
This software will detect human beings in the video fed into it using a surveillance system.
That detection data is used to calculate the distance between the humans detected.
The user is allowed to set a minimum distance and if the calculated distance goes below that threshold limit, the user is notified.

## Entry point : main.py

### The output is currently logged in the terminal window. With a dedicated alarming system, this feature can be enhanced for better impact.
